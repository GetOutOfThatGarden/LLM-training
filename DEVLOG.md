# LLM Training Project - Developer Log

## 2025-09-09

### Technical Work
- Resolved virtual environment activation issues in Trae IDE
- Identified PowerShell execution policy restrictions preventing `.ps1` script execution
- Successfully activated virtual environment using CMD terminal instead of PowerShell
- Documented terminal-specific behavior differences in IDE environments

### Decisions
- **Terminal Choice**: Switched from PowerShell to CMD terminal for virtual environment operations
- **Activation Strategy**: Use `.bat` files instead of `.ps1` scripts to avoid execution policy conflicts
- **IDE Workflow**: Established CMD as the preferred terminal for Python development tasks in Trae

### Narrative
Encountered and solved a common IDE-specific issue where PowerShell execution policies block virtual environment activation scripts. This highlighted the importance of understanding different terminal environments and their security contexts. The solution reinforces that development workflows often require adapting to tool-specific constraints while maintaining productivity.

### Technical Work
- Created comprehensive README.md documentation for the project
- Documented project structure, installation steps, and usage examples
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues like ModuleNotFoundError
- Included configuration options and model architecture details

### Decisions
- **Documentation Strategy**: Chose to create detailed README with both technical and user-friendly sections
- **Structure**: Organized documentation to cover installation, usage, troubleshooting, and future enhancements
- **Examples**: Included practical code examples for both training and text generation

### Narrative
Completed the project documentation phase, making the LLM training framework accessible to other developers. The README serves as both a technical reference and an onboarding guide, reflecting the journey from initial setup challenges to a working ML pipeline.

### Technical Work
- Debugged and resolved multiple dependency installation issues
- Fixed "pip is not recognized" errors by ensuring proper virtual environment activation
- Resolved "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'" by installing required dependencies
- Provided multiple installation approaches (pip vs python -m pip)

### Decisions
- **Environment Management**: Emphasized the importance of virtual environment activation before package installation
- **Installation Strategy**: Recommended both `pip install` and `python -m pip install` approaches for flexibility
- **Error Handling**: Focused on clear diagnostic steps for common Python environment issues

### Narrative
Navigated through the classic Python environment setup challenges that every ML practitioner faces. These debugging sessions highlighted the importance of proper environment isolation and the need for clear setup documentation.

## 2025-09-09

### Technical Work
- Analyzed and debugged issues in `llm_with_saving.py`
- Identified potential problems: empty input sequences, ModelCheckpoint configuration, division by zero risks
- Recommended code improvements including error checking and batch size specification
- Suggested expanding training data for better model performance

### Decisions
- **Error Prevention**: Added input validation to prevent empty sequence processing
- **Checkpoint Strategy**: Modified ModelCheckpoint to use epoch-based saving instead of potentially problematic save_freq
- **Training Robustness**: Implemented safeguards against division by zero in loss calculations
- **Data Quality**: Recommended expanding the limited training dataset

### Narrative
Deep-dived into the ML pipeline to identify potential failure points. This debugging phase revealed the importance of robust error handling in machine learning workflows, especially when dealing with variable input data quality.

## 2025-09-09

### Technical Work
- Set up Python virtual environment in project directory
- Created `venv` folder structure for dependency isolation
- Provided comprehensive virtual environment management commands
- Established workflow for activating, using, and deactivating the environment

### Decisions
- **Environment Isolation**: Chose Python venv over other options (conda, pipenv) for simplicity
- **Location Strategy**: Created virtual environment in project root for easy access
- **Dependency Management**: Planned for TensorFlow, transformers, and datasets installation

### Narrative
Laid the foundation for a clean, reproducible development environment. This initial setup phase is crucial for any ML project, ensuring that dependencies don't conflict with system-wide packages and that the project remains portable across different machines.

## 2025-09-09

### Technical Work
- Developed `llm_with_saving.py` - main LLM training script with checkpointing capabilities
- Created `simple_llm.py` - simplified version for basic LLM operations
- Implemented SimpleLLM class with methods for data preparation, model building, and training
- Added checkpoint management system for model persistence
- Included text generation capabilities with customizable parameters

### Decisions
- **Framework Choice**: Selected TensorFlow/Keras for the ML backend due to its comprehensive ecosystem
- **Architecture**: Implemented LSTM-based language model for text generation
- **Checkpointing**: Used ModelCheckpoint callback for automatic model saving during training
- **Data Structure**: Designed flexible training data format supporting various text types (fairy tales, educational content)

### Narrative
Built the core machine learning infrastructure for training custom language models. The dual-file approach (simple and advanced versions) provides both learning accessibility and production-ready functionality. This represents the transition from concept to working prototype in the LLM training journey.
